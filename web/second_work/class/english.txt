	Lesson 1 A private conversation 私人谈话<br>
	----------------------------------------<br>
	Last week I went to the theatre. <br>
	I had a very good seat.<br>
	The play was very interesting.<br>
	I did not enjoy it.<br>
	A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.<br>
	They were talking loudly.<br>
	I got very angry.<br>
	I could not hear the actors.<br>
	I turned round.I looked at the man and the woman angrily.<br>
	They did not pay any attention.<br>
	In the end, I could not bear it.<br>
	I turned round again.<br>
	'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.<br>
	It’s none of your business,' the young man said rudely.<br>
	 'This is a private conversation!'.<br>
